## Simple Summary
This AIP proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard USDT to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
Supporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.cd ..

The ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Tether or any entity to present this ARC.

The risk parameters provided introduce USDT as a non-collateral asset.

The Interest rate Strategy curve is the same as for USDT in V2. for now.
The ACI is supportive of onboarding USDT as it was in V2.
For now, the ACI doesnâ€™t consider V3 mature enough to activate a USD stablecoins emode and consider USDT in it.
Also, supply and borrow caps are suggested for this asset to limit risk exposure.
