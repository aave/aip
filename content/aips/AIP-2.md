## AIP content in short

- Addition of the AAVE asset in the Aave Money market
- Risk Parameters of 50% LTV, 65% Liquidation threshold and 10% liquidation penalty
- Borrowing of AAVE is disabled


## AIP rationale

AAVE is the native asset and center of gravity of the Aave protocol governance.

Two weeks after the enforcement of the AIP-1 and start of the upgrade from LEND to AAVE, almost 3/4 of the LEND supply have been successfully migrated, The AAVE is also accessible in a wide variety of marketplaces, and the market volume of the AAVE asset greatly exceed the volume of the LEND asset.

LEND, deposits, and usage as collateral have been disabled from the Aave money market and the community sentiment pool to add AAVE as collateral [has received near unanimous support](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-protocol-token-addition-community-sentiment-poll/673).

Potential support for AIP-2 will give current users of aLEND the option to migrate directly their positions using aAAVE as collateral without the need to close them, 10.5% of the supply of LEND currently being in this situation, AIP-2 is expected to accelerate the migration process in favor of AAVE.
