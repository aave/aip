## AIP rationale

During the last months, some steps have been taken via governance to promote migration of liquidity from the version 1 of the protocol to the v2.

Progressively, some changes have been needed on the v1 contracts and configuration to be in line with the migrations ethos, and this proposal helps by improving the mechanism of repayment on behalf in the v1 LendingPool smart contract.
