## Simple Summary

UMA is a popular and essential asset for securing contracts that use UMA Protocol. It is not currently possible to be utilized for borrowing or lending. UMA Protocol is a community-led optimistic oracle that enables anyone to obtain a price on anything. UMA's Optimistic Oracle enables a suite of products such as [KPI Options](https://umaproject.org/kpi-options.html), cross-chain bridges such as [across.to](https://across.to/), [Range tokens](https://umaproject.org/range-tokens.html), [Success Tokens](https://umaproject.org/success-tokens.html) and [Call/Put Options](https://umaproject.org/call-put.html0). 

UMA protocol has a current TVL of $85.2 million. AAVE will obtain a first mover advantage for enabling lending and borrowing services for UMA token. 

## Abstract
Add UMA as a collateral currency on AAVE v2 and v3

Aave would be the first lending platform to support UMA. 

UMA holders could use their existing UMA as collateral to obtain over-collatearlized loans.

## Specification

Add UMA token as a collateral currency on AAVE.

https://etherscan.io/token/0x04Fa0d235C4abf4BcF4787aF4CF447DE572eF828

## Rationale
