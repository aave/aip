## Simple Summary
This AIP proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to increase wstETH supply cap on the Arbitrum v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation

wstETH has reached approximately 95% of its supply cap on Aave V3 Arbitrum.

Increasing this supply cap will enable new Aave users to utilize Aave V3 and allow current users to increase the size of their positions.

The proposed increase is set at a level that allows the market to find a new equilibrium while maintaining a conservative approach.

## Specification

Ticker: wstETH (wstETH)

Contract Address: 0x5979d7b546e38e414f7e9822514be443a4800529

| Parameter | Current | Proposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supply Cap | 1200 | 2400 |


```solidity
contract AaveV3ArbwstETHCapsPayload is IProposalGenericExecutor {
  address public constant WSTETH = AaveV3ArbitrumAssets.WSTETH_UNDERLYING;

  uint256 public constant WSTETH_CAP = 2_400;

  function execute() external {
    IPoolConfigurator configurator = AaveV3Arbitrum.POOL_CONFIGURATOR;

    configurator.setSupplyCap(WSTETH, WSTETH_CAP);
  }
}
```
