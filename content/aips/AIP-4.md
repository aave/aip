## AIP content in short

- Addition of the GUSD stablecoin asset in the Aave Money market
- Asset canâ€™t be used as collateral


## AIP rationale
GUSD is an audited stablecoin issued by Gemini Trust Company, linked to the marketplace Gemini in the US.

Support of AIP-4 will increase the diversification of stablecoins available on the Aave protocol.

GUSD has been integrated into Curve, allowing low slippage swaps with other stablecoins.

GUSD can be converted for USD at a 1:1 ratio on the GEMINI exchange.

Due to current limited volume and supply, this AIP do not support GUSD as collateral but only as a currency for borrowers, with asset growth, Aave governance can decide in a later AIP to add risk parameters to this asset
