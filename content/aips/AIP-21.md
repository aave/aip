## AIP rationale

With the results of the AIP-17 and the kickstart of the GrantsDAO

The Aave protocol and community now have dedicated decentralized entity to incentivize growth and innovation for the Aave ecosystem.

Long-term sustainability of these initiatives can be achieved with the collection and redistribution of the protocol fees.

The reserveFactor allows the FeeCollector smart contract to receive a part of interests paid by takers of liquidity, each asset on AAve has it's own reserveFactor set.

This AIP purpose is to update the reserveFactor of the assets GUSD and CRV.

- GUSD from 0% to 10%

- CRV from 0% to 20%
