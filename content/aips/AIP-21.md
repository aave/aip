## AIP rationale

The reserveFactor allows the FeeCollector smart contract to receive a part of interests paid by takers of liquidity, each asset on AAve has it's own reserveFactor set.

AIP-5 and AIP-6 creators didn't set a reserve factor for GUSD and CRV, which means protocol is not receiving anything from the outstanding debt on these assets.

This AIP purpose is to update the reserveFactor of the assets GUSD and CRV.

- GUSD from 0% to 10%

- CRV from 0% to 20%
