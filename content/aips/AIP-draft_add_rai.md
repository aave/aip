## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for AIPs that want to change Aave. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the AIP solves. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
