## AIP rationale

6.2k stkAAVE (half milion) in my 0x8135908BbcB583D65978acCFe3Da6cA927185Eb1 hacked for unknown reason to 0xD7C40C252cAEBfeA30A02cDC648Bf5CF8Cb690e1
To stop the funds be taken by the hacker, need governance to extend the cooldown period. Then we can discuss how to track down the hacker. 
When the hacker find the cooldown period is extended and could not cash the  stolen fund, he will have to contact AAVE. Then AAVE can get enough information that can lead to a police arrest. If he never shows up and claim the rewards (generated from the stolen fund), we can be sure he is the hacker. We can decide what to do next.
This is a on-going crime and if AAVE does not stop it, AAVE become an accomplice and will face a difficult lawsuit, police and financial authority investigation. Need to avoid.
