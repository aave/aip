## AIP rationale

With the results of AIP-16, A liquidity mining program started on the Aave V2 protocol.

Many protocol took this opportunity to reinforce their synergies with Aave and deposit liquidity on Aave on behalf of their users.

For some protocols based on immutable contracts, participating in the Liquidity mining program requires some slight governance intervention on both sides.

Curve.finance is one of them, they implemented via a community work the compability with the Aave liquidity for their Aave and sAave pools : https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/45

It's now up to the Aave community to strengthten this synergy on Aave side allowing Curve users depositing into Aave to collect both CRV & StkAAVE rewards.
