# Simple Summary

A proposal to adjust seventeen (17) total risk parameters, including Supply Cap and Borrow Cap, across ten (10) assets on Aave V3 Polygon, Arbitrum,and Optimism.

# Motivation

The objective of this proposal is to recommend updated supply and borrow caps for:

1. V3 stablecoins that have excessive supply caps set and/or have no set borrow cap.
- The caps are intended to allow for substantial growth compared to the current supply while not set too excessively.
- The recommendations for the supply caps are set to up to 40% of the circulating supply for most assets and no more than 60%. You can find the exact number for each asset in the tables below. Borrow caps are set to ~65% of the supply cap.
2. V3 assets that have reached over 75% utilization of either cap.
- The recommendations provided in this proposal were derived using Chaos Labsâ€™ [Updated Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-updated-supply-and-borrow-cap-methodology/11602). Below are the data and considerations for the assets and recommended caps for these assets:

There following assets are at >75%. However, we do not recommend increasing their caps at this time due to current liquidity levels:

GHST (V3 Polygon)
SUSHI (V3 Polygon)
BAL (V3 Polygon)
AAVE (V3 Arbitrum)
