## Simple Summary

Add FARM to the Aave platform allowing for depositing and leveraging of the token.

## Paragraph Summary

Adding FARM to the Aave platform for depositing and leveraging will allow users to leverage Aave and Harvest finance to continually stack their earnings. A user leverages their ETH for stable coins at Aave, deposits to Harvest earning APYs which greatly exceed their repay percentage, in addition to receiving FARM rewards which can then be deposited at Aave to leverage more stable coins, and repeat the cycle.

## Motivation

Add FARM as leverageable collateral on Aave.

## Specification

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Community in collaboration with the developers.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the collateral token

FARM is a profit share and governance token for Harvest Finance, an automated yield farming platform. 30% of all cash profits generated by the platform are used to market buy FARM on Uniswap and flows to those staked in the profit share. The platform currently has 30+ active strategies, with $500M TVL and $90M in annualized profits to depositors. The current supply as voted by the community is capped at 690,420 tokens. The coded max supply of the contract is 5M tokens.

3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem: which market? 

Aave v2

4. Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions

The project is 20 weeks old, reaching a peak TVL of $1.1B before a flash loan exploit stole $22M in users funds from two USD vaults (approx 17% loss per impacted user). Post exploit and a TVL low of ~$130M the project (via governance and community voting) issued the GRAIN token at a 1:1 allocation per dollar lost with the intent of continually purchasing back the tokens from the community via an incentivized market using emissions and potentially profits generated by the platform. The TVL of the platform has since rebounded to $500M with new strategies deployed weekly.

5. How is the asset currently used? 

FARM is a profit share token which must be staked in order to receive 30% of profits generated by the platform. Once staked, the users FARM earnings are compounded automatically. Staking in the profit share is also used for governance voting snapshots. 

6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

MCAP: 39.5M / 74.3M

24h Vol: $1.56M

Exchanges: Poloniex, Uniswap, Hotbit, Gate.io, Probit, Hoo, Crypto.com 

7. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)

8. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens

Holders: [https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0246c9032bC3A600820415aE600c6388619A14D#balances](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0246c9032bC3A600820415aE600c6388619A14D#balances)

Deployed on August 31, 2020.

## Technical Specifications

FARM is a mintable ERC20 token with a fixed cap and weekly emission schedule. The token has no rebasing features. The contract is not ownable and there are not privileged features such as burning, upgrades or confiscation of tokens available. Thus, the boilerplate code for Aave lending pool and aToken can be used. No further development should be necessary.
 
For determining the price, we propose using time-weighted average price from Uniswap. This can be combined with a feed of any CEX listed above. A Chainlink oracle is currently not set up.

## Rationale

Add FARM to the Aave platform,  allowing for depositing and leveraging of the token.
