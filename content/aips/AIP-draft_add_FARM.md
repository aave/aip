## Simple Summary

Add iFARM to the Aave platform allowing for depositing and leveraging of the token.

## Paragraph Summary

Adding iFARM to the Aave platform for depositing and leveraging will allow users to leverage Aave and Harvest finance to continually stack their earnings. iFARM represents yield bearing FARM tokens staked within the Harvest Finance profit sharing pool. A user leverages their ETH for stable coins at Aave, deposits to Harvest earning APYs which greatly exceed their repay percentage, in addition to receiving FARM rewards which can then be deposited at Aave to leverage more stable coins, and repeat the cycle.

## Motivation

Add iFARM as leverageable collateral on Aave.

## Specification

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Community in collaboration with the developers.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the collateral token

iFARM represents yield bearing FARM staked within the Harvest Finance Profit Sharing pool. FARM is a profit share and governance token for Harvest Finance, an automated yield farming platform. 30% of all cash profits generated by the platform are used to market buy FARM on Uniswap and flows to those staked in the profit share. The platform currently has 30+ active strategies, with $750M TVL on February 10, 2021 and $90M in annualized profits to depositors. The current supply as voted by the community is capped at 690,420 tokens. The coded max supply of the contract is 5M tokens.

3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem: which market?

Aave v2

4. Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions

The project is 24 weeks old, reaching a peak TVL of $1.1B before a flash loan exploit stole $22M in users funds from two USD vaults (approx 17% loss per impacted user). Post exploit and a TVL low of ~$130M the project (via governance and community voting) issued the GRAIN token at a 1:1 allocation per dollar lost with the intent of continually purchasing back the tokens from the community via an incentivized market using emissions and potentially profits generated by the platform. The TVL of the platform has since rebounded to ~$750M with new strategies deployed weekly.

5. How is the asset currently used?

iFARM represents yield bearing FARM that has been staked within the profit sharing pool. FARM is a profit share token which must be staked in order to receive 30% of profits generated by the platform. Once staked, the users FARM earnings are compounded automatically. Staking in the profit share is also used for governance voting snapshots.

## Technical Specifications

iFARM is an ERC20 token representing yield bearing FARM deposited within the Harvest Finance profit sharing vault. The implementation of iFARM is upgradeable by the governance of Harvest Finance. The upgrades are subjected to 12 hours time lock. Besides that, iFARM does not have privileged features such as burning, upgrades, or confiscation of tokens available. The token has no rebasing features. Thus, the boilerplate code for Aave lending pool and aToken can be used. No further development should be necessary.

The yield bearing asset FARM used to produce iFARM is a mintable ERC20 token with a fixed cap and weekly emission schedule. It has no rebasing features. The contract is not ownable and there are not privileged features such as burning, upgrades or confiscation of tokens available. Its implementation should not affect the implementation of the Aave lending pool and aToken used for iFARM, aside of assessing the feasibility and risk factors.

For determining the price of iFARM, we propose using time-weighted average price of FARM from Uniswap multiplied by the FARM to iFARM exchange ratio that can be read from the iFARM smart contract. This can be combined with a feed of any CEX listed above. A Chainlink oracle is currently not set up.

## Rationale

Add iFARM to the Aave platform, allowing for depositing and leveraging of the token.
