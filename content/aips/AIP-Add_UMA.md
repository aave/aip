## Simple Summary

UMA is a popular and essential asset for securing contracts that use UMA Protocol. It is not currently possible to be utilized for borrowing or lending. UMA Protocol is a community-led optimistic oracle that enables anyone to obtain a price on anything. UMA's Optimistic Oracle enables a suite of products such as [KPI Options](https://umaproject.org/kpi-options.html), cross-chain bridges such as [across.to](https://across.to/), [Range tokens](https://umaproject.org/range-tokens.html), [Success Tokens](https://umaproject.org/success-tokens.html) and [Call/Put Options](https://umaproject.org/call-put.html0). 

UMA protocol has a current TVL of $85.2 million. AAVE will obtain a first mover advantage for enabling lending and borrowing services for UMA token. 

## Abstract
Add UMA as a collateral currency on AAVE v2 and v3

## Motivation

Aave would be the first lending platform to support UMA. 

UMA holders could use their existing UMA as collateral to obtain over-collatearlized loans. 

UMA has a market cap of $1,024,092,720 and is listed on decentralized and centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, OKEx, Huobi, etc.). 

## Specification

Add UMA token as a collateral currency on AAVE. 

Token address: 0x04Fa0d235C4abf4BcF4787aF4CF447DE572eF828

## Rationale

UMA and AAVE are both major driving forces in enabling decentralized financial services to anyone with an internet connect. 

The rationale for adding UMA to the AAVE V2/V3 market is simple; UMA is a popular defi token and an essential asset for securing contracts built on UMA. It is not currently possible to be utilized for borrowing or lending.

## Security Considerations

Contracts built on UMA leverage economic guarantees from UMA protocol whereby the cost to corrupt (i.e. obtain 51% of UMA tokens) must remain greater than the profit from corruption (i.e. the total amount you could steal from contracts on UMA). View here 1 for more information regarding these economic guarantees.

Some security concerns to consider are that someone could use Aave to attempt to obtain 51% or more of the UMA tokens to corrupt a vote and extract value from UMA. If someone does obtain 51% of UMA tokens via a loan on Aave and successfully corrupt a vote the price of UMA token would decrease and so would the bad actorâ€™s debt. Being able to use UMA as collateral to obtain more capital also helps secure the value locked on UMA. Disputers on UMA could have a credit line against UMA tokens in the event they needs to perform very large liquidations but do not have the non-UMA capital on hand to do so. Borrowing is a clean operational approach to obtaining capital and securing the value locked on UMA.
