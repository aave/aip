## Simple Summary
This AIP proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard rETH to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.

## Motivation
Supporting Liquid Staking Derivative (LSDs) diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.

The ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Rocket Pool or any entity to present this AIP.

The risk parameters provided introduce rETH as a collateral asset.

Supply and borrow caps are suggested for this asset to limit risk exposure, the caps have bet proposed by a join collaboration between Gauntlet & Chaos Labs.
