# Summary

This publication presents the community with the opportunity to add LDO to the Ethereum V3 Liquidity Pool.

# Abstract

LDO would be the first Ethereum liquid staking protocol governance token to be listed on Aave. Aave would benefit from being the first major lending market to list LDO. Users will be able to express various trading views on LDOâ€™s price outlook in the lead up to Shanghai. 
 
This publication uses the parameters provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs.

# Motivation

Lido is a suite of software protocols that facilitates liquid staking across multiple blockchains. The Lido DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. The LDO token is used to vote on the use of the DAO treasury associated with the protocols, research and development, and incentive programs.

The Lido DAO is an Aragon organization. The LDO token was created using an [Aragon Minime contract](https://aragon.org/dao). Since Aragon provides a full end-to-end framework to build DAOs, Lido DAO uses its standard tools.

LDO is a Top 50 token by market cap, currently ranked [31st](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao) by Coingecko. Lido Protocol is the largest minter of liquid staked ETH tokens with [5,880,987 ETH staked](https://lido.fi/ethereum).

Making LDO available on Aave v3 would make Aave v3 the first major lending market to do so and would benefit from the first mover advantage.
