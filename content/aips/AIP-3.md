## AIP content in short

- Addition of the UNI asset in the Aave Money market
- Risk Parameters of 40% LTV, 65% Liquidation threshold and 15% liquidation penalty
- Borrowing of UNI is disabled


## AIP rationale
UNI is the governance token of Uniswap Protocol, the DEX with the highest volume. It was distributed to users and liquidity providers gathering a diverse crowd of governors. The Uniswap DAO is now the DAO with the highest value under management.

UNI received clear support from the community during the community sentiment poll with 91% of votes in favor.

UNI is currently added as collateral in the Lending platform Compound with a market of 33M$ and a 65% collateral factor.
