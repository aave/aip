    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nAs stated in the [Aavenomics paper](https://aave.com/Aavenomics.pdf), the AAVE asset is designed to become the center of gravity for Aave governance and the protocol.\n\n\nThe DeFi decentralized ethos has been mostly achieved with protocols on the financial side, creating an ecosystem of financial applications with users in control of their own assets. However, we believe that is only the halfway point of the decentralization objective. Users should also be be in control of the protocol. The AAVE asset is designed for this purpose. This AIP is the first binding step towards the community ownership of the Aave Protocol.\n\n\nThis AIP, if accepted by the community, will slowly deprecate the LEND asset in favour of the AAVE asset. As stated in the Aavenomics, this token upgrade will also create the Ecosystem Reserve (ER), the Safety Module (SM), and start the Safety Incentive (SI) rewards distribution. The Safety Module is designed as an additional line of defense for Aave liquidity providers and as a way for AAVE holders to \"stake\" their assets in exchange for a range of rewards.\n\n\nThis AIP's purpose is also to dedicate a part of the ER to a kickstart incentives for the Safety Module's first quarterly staker distribution.\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Migration of LEND -> AAVE asset with the migration contract\n- Activation of the quarterly plan of Safety Incentives (SI) allocation\n- Start of the Safety Module with initial SI rewards of 400 AAVE/day\n\n## Safety Incentives Schedule\n\nThe bootstrapping phase of the Safety Module will be a step-by-step process in 2 main phases:\n- Initial bootstrapping with launch of the Safety Module, the ability to stake and earn AAVE rewards, but no activation of the protocol protection (i.e slashing) and thus risk-free for stakers.\n- Activation of the Safety Module, a new line of defense for the Aave Protocol users.\n\nThe initial bootstrapping phase rationale is designed to have lower rewards and a risk-free environment to allow the majority of LEND holders to migrate at their own pace. This encourages a careful approach while interacting with critical migration and staking smart-contracts.\n\nAfter activation of the Safety Module, the Aave governance can adjust the Safety Incentive (SI) schedule and emissions rate.\n\nThe Safety Incentive's allocation quarterly date should be voted on before the end of the 3 months (90 days) distribution schedule. In the case of a late or no vote on a new SI allocation plan, the current allocation will continue until a vote or until the ER is empty.\n\n## Mainnet addresses and relevant notes\n\nIf this AIP is validated by a community vote, the following addresses will be involved in the migration process :\n\n- [0x8a2efd9a790199f4c94c6effe210fce0b4724f52](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a2efd9a790199f4c94c6effe210fce0b4724f52) AaveProtoGovernance : the governance contract\n- [0x7Fc66500c84A76Ad7e9c93437bFc5Ac33E2DDaE9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#code) AAVE token contract : the ERC20 AAVE token contract\n- [0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5) StakedAave : The Staking contract for AAVE\n- [0x317625234562b1526ea2fac4030ea499c5291de4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x317625234562b1526ea2fac4030ea499c5291de4) LendToAaveMigrator : The migration contract\n- [0x95a4949f09415b12da789e144b2522956620d005](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95a4949f09415b12da789e144b2522956620d005) AaveGenesisPayloadProposal : Contract in charge of enforcement of the AIP outcome\n- [0xa133459b2502b0137e85a446fa8d4e300877a007](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa133459b2502b0137e85a446fa8d4e300877a007) AaveGenesisExecutor : Contract enforcing a 24h delay on enforcement of AIP outcome to allow the community to be prepared to migrate\n- [0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491#code) AaveIncentivesVault : Ecosystem Reserve\n\n\nThe migration process for every LEND holder will leverage the method `migrateFromLend()` with a simple `uint256` input of the amount.

    "description": "\n## Simple Summary\nxSUSHI is the governance token of Sushiswap, a community-led DEX with a current TVL of more than 1.1B.\n\n## Abstract\nAdd xSushi to the AAVE V2 market.\n\n## Motivation\nAave would be the first platform to support xSushi a yield bearing asset with over of 100m$ currently under utilized.\n\nAavengers could use their platform of predilection to borrow their existing xSushi.\n\nSupport community-led projects.\n\n## Specification\nxSushi is one of the two currently supported assets for Sushi governance (ETH/SUSHI SLP being the other one). We are currently not fully decentralized but the members of the Ops multisig and Treasury multisig are bound to respect all of the governance votes. We do plan to be a real DAO most likely leveraging Aragon v2 in 6 to 12 months depending on the progress made by community.\n\nxSushi is receiving 0.05% of all the swaps happening on Sushiswap and should also benefits from all of the future revenues streams from upcoming platforms such as Bento-Miso-Gusoku-Deriswap and more.\n\nThe current yield on this asset alone is hovering around 10-40% APY with over $100MM locked in the Sushibar making it an ideal productive asset as collateral.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe rationale for adding xSushi to the AAVE V2 market is simple; xSushi is a popular yield bearing asset but is currently incapable of being utilized for borrowing or lending.\n\nSUSHI can currently be borrowed and lent on [cream.finance](https://app.cream.finance/). However, xSushi cannot be borrowed or lent on any platform currently. By allowing xSushi to be borrowed and lent on AAVE v2, this will allow xSushi holders to access the liquidity of their platform\n\n\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->\n\n## Test Cases\n\n*see implementation*\n\n## Implementation\nAAVE does not use TWAP oracle and xSushi does not have sufficient liquidity on centralized exchanges we will calculate the xSushi using the existing oracle of SUSHI and applying a calculated exchange rate.\n\nThe price oracle for xSushi will calculate the price using a SUSHI price oracle multiplied by the exchange rate for SUSHI<>xSushi.\n\n`xSushiPrice = sushiPrice * exchangeRate`\n\nTo calculate the exchange rate we will check the SUSHI balance of the xSushi contract.\n\nAn example implementation of exchange rate calculation can be found below\n\n```js\nlet sushi = new ethers.Contract('0x6b3595068778dd592e39a122f4f5a5cf09c90fe2', abi, provider)\n\nlet totalSushiStakedinXSushi = await sushi.methods.balanceOf('0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272').call()\n\nlet xSushi = new ethers.Contract('0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272', abi, provider)\n\nlet totalXSushiSupply = await xSushi.methods.totalSupply().call()\n\nlet exchangeRate = totalSushiStakedinBar.div(totalXSushiSupply)\n```\n\nAt the request of the AAVE team we have included a convenience contract for returning the exchange rate of Sushi -> xSushi exchange rate.\n\n[Exchange Rate contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE8061286f2975EF38c8F70607eD839Fc9C0f0090#readContract)\n[Exchange Rate contract repo](https://github.com/sushiswap/xsushi-exchange-rate)\n\nValues from the `getExchangeRate()` method are returned as `uint256` values with a pecision of `10**18`\n\nLastly, xSushi is explicitly convertible for SUSHI at the exchange rate described above. Fees are paid as SUSHI to xSushi holders and collected into a pool of SUSHI, where each xSushi token represents a proportional share in the pool size. In essence SUSHI fees paid are accumulated to the xSushi which are not redeemable without the destruction of the underlying xSushi.\n\nSince debts incurred on AAVE would require that the debt be repaid in xSushi, the fees that are accumulated are safe from being harvested.\n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Peckshield & Quantstamp](https://docs.defisafety.com/finished-reviews/sushiswap-process-quality-audit#audits)\n\n[**AAVE Community xSushi Risk Assement**](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-xsushi/1794/16)\n\n![Screenshot 2021-01-05 at 19.56.10](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/1X/e35ebb4c429ea6e1162d1fd6faf7d7b624287a14_2_690x184.png)\n\nSushiSwap is a DEX forked of Uniswap that grew very fast, now at $1.6B of TVL, thanks to generous liquidity mining incentives. It is now part of the Yearn conglomerate with many new upcoming features.\n\nxSUSHI is the staked SUSHI that receives .05% of the fees with 10 to 40% APY a great property for a collateral. The redeeming process from xSUSHI to SUSHI is permissionless allowing the analysis to focus on SUSHI.\n\n[**SUSHI Smart contract**](https://ethplorer.io/address/0x6b3595068778dd592e39a122f4f5a5cf09c90fe2) **Risk: B-**\n\nSUSHI was launched late August by a fork of the Uniswap Exchange. Shortly after launch, the key developer stole the development funds, eventually returning them. The network managed secure support from some industry leaders and has grown fast in these few month reaching two dozen users and over a billion transactions.\n\n**SUSHI Counterparty Risk: B**\n\nSushi is a permissionless blockchain protocol where token holders vote on incentives and upgrades. Anyone can create new Sushi markets.\n\n[**SUSHI Market**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sushi) **Risk: C +**\n\nSUSHI has a good market capitalisation with a high volume. The price has suffered from extreme volatility since inception, suffering from large drops in value which is problematic for a collateral, requiring prudent parameters.

This has generated a consistent amount of stable rate debt, which results in frictions for the V1 liquidity providers and integrators that still rely on Aave V1 for their deposits.\n\nIf this proposal is approved by the Aave governance, new stable rates loans positions will be disabled for Aave V1.\n\nThe rebalancing mechanism will also be updated to an enforced swap to variable rates. Which means, in case of extremely high borrowing pressure on the stablecoins reserves, users at stable rate will be migrated to variable until rebalancing conditions are not satisfied anymore.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\nDeactivation of the ability to open new stable rate borrowing positions on Aave V1 and update of the rebalance mechanism\n\n## Implementations details\n\nExecutes the proposal deployed at\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x6a46c03c861cab74c8a213983b7eb295234c16b3#code\n\nThe proposal executes the following:\n\n- Updates the LendingPool implementation to \n\n  https://etherscan.io/address/0xDB9217fad3c1463093fc2801Dd0a22C930850A61#code\n\n- Updates the LendingPoolCore implementation to\n\n  https://etherscan.io/address/0x2847A5D7Ce69790cb40471d454FEB21A0bE1F2e3#code\n\n  These contract updates are needed to update the implementation of the rebalanceStableRate() function\n\n- Execute disableReserveStableBorrowRate() in all the assets listed on the protocol V1\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

It is an uncollateralized financial primitive with an elastic supply that adjusts each day according to demand in the marketplace. Ample targets the 2019 USD. Like Bitcoin, Ample is non-dilutive but it has a long-term unit of account that unlocks safe denomination of debt. The goal of Ampleforth is to create a building block for a safer, more resilient financial ecosystem.\n\nBeing able to borrow and lend AMPL would enable holders to:\n\n- Utilize a new, low-correlated collateral asset which could reduce risk\n- Decrease exposure to rebases in exchange for income from interest\n- Use a non-collateralized asset that “[borrows like a stablecoin](https://medium.com/ampleforth/elastic-finance-lending-213e02de0583)\"\n- Create leveraged AMPL trades and unlock derivatives\n- Create interest bearing AMPL that can be staked in other protocols\n- Increase exposure to AMPL & farming\n\n## Motivation\nAMPL total supply and balances change once every 24 hours (at 2am UTC) based on market price. The supply change factor is the same for all holders. Because of that, lending and borrowing AMPL behaves differently from fixed supply tokens.\n\nThe desired behavior is for the borrow amount (loan) to stay the same after a rebase. The unborrowed tokens deposited in the Aave protocol still get exposed to rebase just like any other contract wallet. This means aAMPLs \"partially rebase\", in accordance with the utilization ratio.\n\nThe AMPL AToken functionally behaves similarly to every other AToken. It maintains a 1:1 peg with the underlying AMPL.\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCo-founder, developer\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the collateral token\nSee Summary\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem: which market?\n\nThe asset will be listed in the current AAVE V2 market.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and how it overcame stressed conditions\n\nAmpleforth launched in July, 2019. Since then, Ample has executed over 550 days of rebases. The network was subject to extreme growth and volatility following the launch of the Geyser liquidity mining program in July 2020. It has shown resilience with a lifetime median price of $1.00 and average price of $1.02 (vs target price of $1.02). There are currently over 22K holders and is a top 100 currency by Market Cap.\n\nOnchain network history viewable on [Dashboard](https://www.ampleforth.org/dashboard/).\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nAmple aims to be a financial building block that supports a robust and stable financial ecosystem. Borrowing and lending is a critical layer of this stack. [Current roadmap](https://www.ampleforth.org/roadmap/).\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nAmple has developed deep liquidity on AMMs like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Mooniswap, and a Smart Pool on Balancer through its liquidity mining program.\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ampleforth#markets\n\n7. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nLinks above\n\n8. Risk Assessment and Parameter suggestions\n\nAMPL has been evaluated as low technical risk because it doesn't have any potential of infinite or uncontrolled minting.\n\nGiven the novel mechanism of rebasing, it will only be used as a borrowing currency for the time being. An evalution of whether to give it collateral status will be performed afterward.\n\nA 3rd party Audit report from Peckshield can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/50290685aa3b68eea18f4a908748aafb05db96ab/audits/PeckShield-Audit-Report-aAMPL-v1.0.pdf).\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\nWe implement a custom AToken, StableDebtToken and VariableDebtToken for AMPL. The StableDebtToken and VariableDebtToken implementations make no functional changes to the generic implementation. When the debt tokens are minted and burned, it performs some additional book-keeping to keep track of the totalScaledAMPL (fixed AMPL denomination, ie Gons) borrowed at any-time. The new getAMPLBorrowData method returns the totalScaledAMPL and totalScaledSupply which are used for AAmplToken math.\n\nGeneric AToken has a private balance and public balance. The public balance returned by balanceOf is multiplied by an interest rate factor. The aAMPL works the same way but the AAmplInternal balance is multiplied by another factor, which accounts for the underlying AMPL rebasing and the amount of AMPL unborrowed.\n\n### Code\nAAMPL token address: 0x938Eb0b3C4Bb93aF924ACbf9d3dBD444153F7Ba8\nCode verified [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x938Eb0b3C4Bb93aF924ACbf9d3dBD444153F7Ba8#code)\n\nSteps the proposal will execute:\n1. Start a vote to add aAMPL as a new asset.\n\n### Test Cases\n- [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a4zd7UL-U5Xrme9b0X5B39nJzjrFwfG1?usp=sharing) of test cases\n- Unit tests included with code change\n\n### Security Considerations\n- Standard technical risks of smart contracts apply to the AToken implementation.\n- Market risk resulting from first borrow/lending market for a rebasing currency.\n",

But these applications need a robust lending market to thrive, so storage miners can borrow renFIL/FIL to stake and FIL holders can earn a return on their holdings.\n\nThis proposal describes adding depositing and borrowing (not collateral) support for renFIL to the Aave market to unlock these new applications, expose the Filecoin community to Aave, and create a large new market on the protocol. [Ren Protocol](https://renproject.io/) was chosen as the tokenization service because it is already managing large bridges in production, including [$301 million in renBTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/renbtc) as of this writing. Collateral support for renFIL may be added later, but we recommend waiting for more price stability of FIL and renFIL before enabling.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nFilecoin, and by extension, renFIL is unlike any other digital asset currently available in the Aave market, as it allows the purchase of hosting space on the permissionless Filecoin network. As a result, being able to lend and borrow renFIL will unlock many new DeFi applications, including:\n\n* Storage mining syndicates\n* Data markets\n* Shared UIs/images/content\n* Lossless capital hosting\n\nJust see the recent [EthGlobal<>Protocol Labs Hackathon](https://hack.ethglobal.co/hackfs/showcase) and [Filecoin Launchpad](https://www.filecoinlaunchpad.co/)for hints of what is possible at the intersection of Filecoin+DeFi. The Filecoin community is massive and growing everyday, however, many of the participants are unfamiliar with Aave and DeFi. Adding renFIL to Aave would dramatically increase support for these efforts, would bring Filecoin users/developers into the Aave ecosystem, and allow capital, yield, and value to accrue to Aave participants.\n\n## Specification\n\n\n### Project\nFilecoin is a distributed storage network based on a blockchain mechanism. Filecoin miners can elect to provide storage capacity for the network, and thereby earn units of the Filecoin cryptocurrency (FIL) by periodically producing cryptographic proofs that certify that they are providing the capacity specified. In addition, Filecoin enables parties to exchange FIL currency through transactions recorded in a shared ledger on the Filecoin blockchain. Rather than using Nakamoto-style proof of work to maintain consensus on the chain, however, Filecoin uses proof of storage itself: a miner’s power in the consensus protocol is proportional to the amount of storage it provides.\n\nFilecoin was founded in 2015 by [Juan Benet](https://twitter.com/juanbenet), has been backed by Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Union Square Ventures, and its mainnet went live on October 15, 2020. The network is governed by the Filecoin Foundation and the Filecoin Foundation for Decentralised Web.\n\n## Rationale\n\n\nThe REN token is already supported in the Aave market, and renBTC is one of the most popular cross-chain tokens today. In unifying the Filecoin and DeFi ecosystems, Ren protocol is a natural bridge and has the technical expertise and experience to get the job down securely and safely.\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n\nThe Filecoin price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes both [FIL/ETH and FIL/USD feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nThe renFIL token will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following strategy params are proposed:\n\n```\nIReserveParams = {\n  optimalUtilizationRate: new BigNumber(0.8).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  baseVariableBorrowRate: '0',\n  variableRateSlope1: new BigNumber(0.07).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  variableRateSlope2: new BigNumber(3).multipliedBy(oneRay).toFixed(),\n  stableRateSlope1: '0',\n  stableRateSlope2: '0',\n  baseLTVAsCollateral: '0',\n  liquidationThreshold: '0',\n  liquidationBonus: '0',\n  borrowingEnabled: true,\n  stableBorrowRateEnabled: false,\n  reserveDecimals: '18',\n  aTokenImpl: eContractid.AToken,\n  reserveFactor: '3500'\n};\n```\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n```\n    New interest bearing asset deployed on main:\n    Interest bearing aRENFIL address: 0x5CAF29fD8efbe4ED0cfc43A8a211B276E9889583\n    Variable Debt variableDebtRENFIL address: 0x4B20f007d0c1567Ca8a6e80B8a8EE19Ac59C6a08\n    Stable Debt stableDebtRENFIL address: 0xf22b80D58a7cCDEd772E0997AE90a6C77940B051\n    Strategy Implementation for RENFIL address: 0xb140cb1306B396c658A5438602b6857842E1E98a\n```\n\n### Test Cases\n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Ren Protocol audits from ChainSecurity, ConsenSys Diligence, and Trail of Bits](https://github.com/renproject/ren/wiki/Audits)\n\n[Filecoin audits and bug bounty](https://security.filecoin.io/)\n\n[AAVE Community renFIL Risk Assement](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-renfil-filecoin/1059/17?u=corbpage)\n\n![renFIL Risk Screenshot](../assets/AIP-add_renFIL_support/renFIL_risk_screenshot.png)\n\n[**RenFIL Smart contract Risk**](https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd5147bc8e386d91cc5dbe72099dac6c9b99276f5): **C**\n\nRenVM is a byzantine fault-tolerant network that is able to securely in a decentralized manner do ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via sMPC, which allows RenVM to securely manage private keys of different assets like Bitcoin and Filecoin, and wrap these assets on smart-contract chains. Since launch, RenVM has processed around $1.5B in total volume of Bitcoin, Filecoin, Zcash, Bitcoin cash going to and from Ethereum. The smart contract risks of RenFIL are mitigated by those of RenBTC which has been battle tested by the markets.\n\nTechnically, renFIL is a proxied token standard ERC with some features on top:\n\n* Mechanism of exchange rate (similar to Aave slashing)\n* Permit for approvals\n* Recovery of other tokens sent to the contract\n\n**RenFIL Counterparty Risk: C**\n\nThere is a proxy admin which can update all the logic of the contract with a 7 days timelock controller by a multisig, controlled by the team. Even with 7 days, it may be impossible to mitigate the consequences of a contract upgrade with minting for example.\n\nFurthermore there is an EOA (Externally Owned Account) with permissions to mint, burn, change the exchange rate and decide which tokens sent by mistake to the renFIL contract are recoverable.\n\nThis results in the capability to burn tokens of a particular address (potentially the ones contained in aToken) and the change of the implementation under the proxy.\n\n[RenFIL Market 1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/renfil): **Risk B (based on FIL)**\n\nRenFIL market capitalisation is unknown with very little liquidity in the markets.

    "basename": "AIP-16",
    "description": "\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe believe that a well designed LM program can accomplish the following:\n\nGrow lending and borrowing activity in targeted markets: With almost every major DeFi protocol launching a liquidity mining program, we believe it would be advantageous for Aave to utilize part of the Ecosystem Reserve to drive lending and borrowing activity across markets. Distributing AAVE to borrowers and lenders acts as an added incentive to attract more capital. The distribution can become more targeted over time. For example, certain markets may need more AAVE than others based on liquidity, utilization, and maturity of the market.\n\nBroader distribution and protocol decentralization: Rewarding AAVE to users of the protocol improves the distribution of the AAVE token. This gets AAVE into the hands of more users, further decentralizing the protocol.\n\nDeprecating Aave v1: Due to high gas fees and a lack of incentive to migrate, Aave v1 still contains approximately 40% of the value locked in the broader Aave protocol. By introducing liquidity mining rewards only on Aave v2, liquidity providers and borrowers will naturally migrate toward the optimized version. Declining liquidity on Aave v1 will facilitate a gradual deprecation of this iteration of the protocol, allowing more development activity to be directed at Aave v2.\n\nThis program is being proposed as a beta to further investigate how the inclusion of liquidity mining rewards will benefit the Aave ecosystem. From a supply perspective, this distribution results in only 5% of the fully diluted AAVE supply released each year. This enables Aave to experiment with liquidity mining rewards while saving the majority of the ecosystem reserves for other growth initiatives and grants. If this AIP passes, the Aave community can reflect on total supply/borrow and utilization by market to further refine the distribution program.\n\nThe forum [poll](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-introduce-liquidity-incentives-for-aave-v2/2340/27) closed with 62% of participants supportive of introducing rewards.\n\n## AIP rationale\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across supported markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market. While Aave has seen success without rewards so far, this program would attempt to supercharge its growth at a relatively low cost to the treasury and AAVE holders.\n\nThis distribution strategy rewards markets based on borrow demand. Markets with higher dollar value borrowed receive a higher share of the daily stkAAVE rewards. stkAAVE will be allocated at a 50/50 ratio between lenders and borrowers across stablecoin markets. In WBTC and ETH markets, the ratio between lenders and borrowers will be 95/5 to discourage riskier borrowing activity.\n\nstkAAVE will be rewarded instead of AAVE to align long-term incentives, disincentivize speculative farmers, and allow users to earn an underlying yield on top of the AAVE they earn. This helps align LPs by giving them more governance weight upfront and secure the protocol by increasing the amount of AAVE staked in the Safety Module. LPs then immediately earn a staking yield on their vested AAVE.\n\nstkAAVE requires a 10 day cooldown period. The cooldown period must be started before LPs can unstake their AAVE. After the cooldown period, users have a 2 day window to unstake.\n\nTo simplify the implementation and allow the community to analyze the distribution first, this proposal does not include a vesting component. As we approach the target end date for the LM program, we encourage the community to explore any vesting structures for stkAAVE.\n\nWe propose 7/15/21 as the target end date for this liquidity mining program. A mid-July end date gives the community 3 months of activity to analyze before voting to end, continue, or adjust the LM program.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\nThe purpose of this AIP is to introduce liquidity mining rewards for Aave v2.\n\nThis AIP would distribute 2,200 Staked AAVE (stkAAVE) per day, representing around 1M$ in rewards distributed daily to lenders and borrowers. Users will receive stkAAVE.\n\n2,200 stkAAVE per day will be allocated pro-rata across the following markets based on the dollar value of the borrowing activity in the underlying market:\n\n![Aave](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aave/aip/Pending-AIPs/content/assets/AIP-16/aip16-img.png)\n\n\n$ Value as of 3/22/21\n\nThis program is structured as a beta, with the opportunity to track protocol activity and refine the distribution in the future.\n\nThe distribution has a target end date of 7/15/21. The community will be able to review the results of the LM program and adjust any parameters accordingly.\n\n## Abstract\n\nDistribute 2,200 stkAAVE daily from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/incentives-policy-and-aave-reserve) to borrowers and lenders\n\nEcosystem Reserve contract : https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491#code\n\n## Implementations details\n\nProposal contract:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x5778DAee2a634acd303dC9dC91e58D57C8FFfcC8#code\n\nThe proposal will update the aDAI/GUSD/USDC/USDT/WBTC/WETH implementations and the variableDebt DAI/GUSD/USDC/USDT/WBTC/WETH implementation to set the Incentives controller to https://etherscan.io/address/0x5778DAee2a634acd303dC9dC91e58D57C8FFfcC8.

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIntroduce the Aave Grants DAO (AGD) to fund ideas submitted by the Aave community.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose starting a community-led grants DAO to fund ideas submitted by the Aave community, with a focus on empowering a wider network of community developers. The pilot program will be over two quarters. The grants budget will be $1 million per quarter and the operating budget will be $250,000 over two quarters. The operating budget will be used to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. A committee of 8 members, including one lead, will oversee the grants program. \n\nIf this AIP is approved, 2,809 AAVE ($1.25 million) will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491) to the [grants DAO multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0/balances). The remaining $1 million will be funded in the beginning of the second quarter of the grants program.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave has an ecosystem reserve of $1.2B or 2.7m AAVE as of 4/27/21, which is available to fund growth and community initiatives, part of which could be used to fund grants. However, it is currently not easy for the community to allocate from the reserve to fund proposals.\n\nTo promote inclusivity and a more visible and transparent avenue for funding development in the Aave ecosystem, while maintaining the decentralized nature of the ecosystem, we propose a community-led grants program called Aave Grants DAO.\n\nThe goal of the program is to provide resources to grow the Aave ecosystem in a way that can scale over time. There are many great ideas for improving the Aave protocol bubbling up in the Discord, community forum and other places. We hope to initiate a community-led, transparent process for connecting those developers/creators/innovators with resources needed to go from idea to funded development.\n\nGiven the difficulty of decentralizing grants administration, we propose establishing a committee which has the power to administer grants on a discretionary basis. The focus will be on disbursing grant funding effectively and quickly to individuals and teams working to improve the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur proposal is inspired by the grants programs of Compound and Uniswap, which have both received approvals to deploy $1m and $750k per quarter, respectively.\n\nWe propose to run the pilot grants program over two quarters. We request a max grants budget of $2m and a max operating budget of $250k. The operating budget will be used to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program.\n\nThere will be two types of grants that the grants committee can approve:\n1. Rapid grants: < $100k, simple process to apply for a grant to AGD, relatively quick grant decision\n2. Community grants: $100k-$500k, initial application followed by posting proposal on governance forum, committee can decide to approve these grants based on feedback from community\n\nContributors can also seek grants over $500k but they will not go through the committee. They will have to be posted on Aave’s governance forum and approved through an on-chain vote.\n\nThe expenses will be priced in USD terms at the beginning of each quarter. The reviewers will ensure that all unspent funds will be returned to the Ecosystem Reserve at the conclusion of the pilot. If the program is underfunded because AAVE’s token price falls significantly, the committee may request the underfunded amount from governance. After running the pilot program for two quarters, the community can vote to continue, modify, or discontinue the program.\n\nApplications will be reviewed and funded on a rolling basis. The applications approved and funded within each quarter will form a funding round which will be tracked, supported and documented.\n\nDocumentation of results will be made available to the community at the end of each round, at which point we will solicit feedback from the community. The idea is to start with a rough MVP and evolve through community feedback. We expect to learn a lot about how to do this right in the first 2 quarters and anticipate making changes to the grants program over time through subsequent proposals.\n\n## Committee Members\n\nWe propose a committee of 8 members: 1 lead and 7 reviewers. The lead will be the organizational backbone of the program and ensure that things move smoothly and efficiently. The lead will likely dedicate a significant amount of time to the program.\n\nReviewers will process applications, ensure that the lead is acting in good faith and is effective in their role, and will operate a 4 of 7 multisig which disburses funds to grantees. The reviewers will also hold the program accountable to its goals and objectives and return any excess funds to the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. Reviewers are likely to dedicate a smaller amount of time to the program.\n\nBoth the lead and the reviewers will serve for a period of two quarters. After two quarters, the grants program and the committee member positions will be up for renewal. This will be put up on the governance forum for a discussion and subsequent on-chain vote.\n\nMembers may be replaced during the pilot program, for example, if they find they are not able to dedicate sufficient time to the program. We aim to be as transparent as possible and get feedback on the Aave forum if there are any changes to the committee during the program.\n\nThe committee is composed as follows:\n\nLead: [Shreyas Hariharan](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas) - Llama\n\nShreyas is the founder of Llama, which helps DeFi protocols and DAOs manage their treasury. He has actively worked on treasury spending, allocation, and reporting. He is working on a treasury strategy for Uniswap and serving as a reviewer for Uniswap grants. As an Aave community member and token holder, he is excited to help grow the Aave ecosystem through the grants program.\n\nReviewers:\n\n1.

[Calvin Chu](https://twitter.com/calchulus) - Independent\n\n## Budget\n\nWe request a max grants budget of $2m to distribute grants and a max operating budget of $250k over two quarters to pay the lead, reviewers, lawyer, and other administrative costs to set up the grants program. This will be funded by the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.\n\nPayments to the lead will be approved by the reviewers and made at the end of every month (i.e., if the program begins on 4/30/21, the lead will be paid on 5/30/21, and the again on 6/30/21 and 7/30/21 based on hours worked). Payments to reviewers will also be made every month based on hours worked.\n\nAny changes to the AGD including renewal of the program at the end of 2 quarters, total quarterly budget and committee compensation will require full quorum.\n\n## Committee Compensation\n\nWe suggest compensation for the lead roughly in line with the initial Uniswap and Compound proposals - $100/hr for a maximum of 40 hrs/week. This compensation will be allocated to the AGD multisig from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve as part of the overall funding for the program.\n\nThe time commitment for the reviewers is likely to be far lower. The compensation for reviewers will be $100/hr for a maximum of 5 hrs/week.\n\n## Priorities\n\nTo help inform the types of grants which are most likely to get funded, we highlight the following target areas:\n\n1. Protocol development (including core Aave protocol development, development of higher layer protocols which use the Aave protocol)\n2. Applications and integrations (front-ends and other applications that use the Aave protocol)\n3. Developer tooling\n4. Community (marketing and educational)\n5. Committees, sub-committees, and DAOs that serve the Aave ecosystem\n6. Code audits\n7. Events and hackathons\n8. Bounties\n\n## What does success look like?\n\nWe will evaluate the success of the program against the following criteria:\n\nMeasurable criteria:\n\n1. Growth in the number of grants applications received quarter-over-quarter\n2. Growth in the number of projects, ideas, and events funded\n3. Growth in community engagement (e.g. increased activity on forums, Discord, etc.)\n4. Growth in Aave pools driven by applications funded via grants (e.g. increased TVL, borrow activity, and unique addresses due to apps funded by grants)\n\nSubjective criteria:\n\n1. Improved sentiment and goodwill within the community\n2. Improvement to the Aave protocol’s brand and positioning in the market\n\n## Timeline / Process\n\nWe will organize grant recipients into two 3-month funding rounds. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis and any grants disbursed during a given 3-month period become part of the corresponding round. Round 1 will be for three months from the day the grants proposal has been approved. For example, if the proposal is approved on 4/30/2021, Round 1 of the grants program will be from 4/30/2021 to 7/30/2021 and Round 2 of the grants program will be from 7/30/2021 to 10/30/2021.\n\nIf approved, starting immediately after a proposal is ratified, AGD will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. The grants committee will determine on how funding is to be disbursed (e.g. milestones, upfront, etc.) on a case-by-case basis. In general, the goal will be to align long-term incentives with the interests of the Aave community and AAVE holders.\n\nAt the end of each round, the committee is responsible for sharing all the grant recipients along with amounts and descriptions as part of a transparent quarterly review process. The end of the Round 2 marks the end of the pilot. At that point, the community will decide based on the results of the first two rounds whether or not to continue funding AGD (in the same or an amended form).\n\nMost grants will have 1-2 milestones and recipients will receive about half the grant upfront and half on the completion of a milestone. For more complex projects or larger grants, there may be several milestones and payments could be split across these milestones. AGD will get progress updates from teams and assess the completion of these milestones. This ensures downside protection for the AGD in case the project is unsuccessful or needs to pivot.\n\nThe grants will primarily be focused on projects working to improve the Aave protocol. However, a small portion of the budget (5-10%) may be allocated to select projects with a wider scope (e.g. ETH scalability).\n\nIf AGD has distributed all grants but has more promising projects to fund, it can propose increasing the budget to governance. However, it is entirely up to the Aave community to vote on whether to increase the budget.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIf this AIP is approved, 2,809 AAVE ($1.25 million) will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Reserve](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491) to the [grants committee multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0/balances). $1 million will fund the first quarter of Aave grants and $250,000 will cover two quarters of operating expenses for the program. The remaining $1 million will be funded in the beginning of the second quarter of the grants program.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Up until now, 2.5M LEND have been burned, which will not be converted to AAVE.\nAs a result of the migration, the LEND liquidity has shrunk considerably, which makes it very hard to buy LEND on dexes for the burning.\n\nThe LEND burner currently holds around 20K of funds, distributed across all the different Aave V1 reserves (mostly stablecoins). The burner contract is here https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae \n\nThis AIP proposes to stop the LEND burning. Instead, the idea is to collect the fees accrued by AAVE V1 to bootstrap a protocol fund. \n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Deprecation of the current TokenDistributor contract\n- Implementation of the following strategy instead of burning:\n  \n  1. Remove the assets conversion to LEND and subsequent burning\n  2. The assets are moved to the AAVE Collector contract, under direct control of the AAVE governance (https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n- The implementation will keep the current redistribution of the referral fees (20% of the total) to continue with the referral distribution as until now.\n\n## Implementation details\n\n- Upgrade of the TokenDistributor contract https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae \n- Modify the distribute() function as follows:\n\n  1.

Move the assets to 0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\nDistribution to the current referral fees wallet will be kept.\n  \n## Proposal data\n\nAIP2 Payload:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4b7c3e3ea48f80a78487067cd08b9a8430eb8eb5\n\nNew TokenDistributor Implementation:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x62C936a16905AfC49B589a41d033eE222A2325Ad\n\nAave Collector contract:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nReflexer Labs has designed a new type of stable asset called RAI, an ETH backed stablecoin with a moving peg. RAI aims to become an autonomous, crypto native and stable unit of account for the DeFi industry.\n\n## Abstract\n\nRAI is an asset backed only by ETH, governance-minimized, and programmed to maintain its own price stability without needing to peg to an external price reference like the USD. We believe these qualities make RAI ideal initially as an alternative to pegged-coins for use in DeFi as collateral and as a stable reserve asset, especially for programs where resilience is critical.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntroducing more trustless, stable assets into Aave money markets will benefit both Aave and the ecosystem as a whole. The addition of RAI will diversify the protocol’s exposure to stable assets beyond traditional dollar-pegged stablecoins and provide enough bandwidth to grow the protocols TVL.\n\nCurrently, more than $4.56B worth of stable asset liquidity on Aave V1 and V2 is centralised (USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD, GUSD) while only $1.25B (~25%) is decentralised (DAI, sUSD). While this isn’t inherently a negative, introducing more decentralised, stable assets adds to Aave’s composability and resilience.\n\nRAI also stands to benefit from being able to expand its utility and liquidity across the largest lending protocol in the space, allowing for more experimentation to occur in the ongoing journey towards entirely trustless and decentralized stable-credit.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCo-founder of Reflexer.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nRAI is a decentralized non-pegged ETH-back stable asset meant to act as pristine collateral in DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nOther stablecoins are either centralized or pegged to the dollar. RAI is neither of those and aligns perfectly with the ethos of trust-minimized finance.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRAI launched in February and has amassed over $100M in liquidity with $300M in value locked. RAI is governance minimised by design, as well as currently moving towards a grants DAO.\n\n5.How is the asset currently used?\n\nRAI is currently used as a trust-minmized alternative to other stablecoins. The goal is to drive adoption of RAI to be used as collateral in money markets, other synthetic assets, and more.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule. Similar to DAI, RAI minted on demand when users lock ETH into the protocol.\n\n7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nRight now the protocol is almost fully upgradeable. This includes anything from oracles, the contract that collects stability fees, the contract that liquidates positions, the one that auctions collateral etc. This is managed through a multisig with a 6 hour delay on any governance action. Managed by the Reflexer core team. The multisig manages the full system and will do so until rai is gov minimized.\n\nOn the other hand, the contract that keeps track of debt and collateral in all Safes (CDPs) cannot be upgraded.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n    Market Cap: $67M\n    24h Volume: $8M\n    Volatility: Very Low\n    Maturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\n10K followers on Twitter, 4.7K members on Discord, Github is highly active.\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\n    Date of Deployment: February 13th, 2021\n    Number of Transactions: 40,000+\n    Number of Holders: 2,000+\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe decision to design RAI as it is today came from the desire to achieve three main goals.\n\n1. DeFi Lego\n\n- Fork of MakerDAO’s Multi-Collateral DAI (MCD)\n- Governance-minimized in the Long Run\n- Algorithmic (PI controller) interest rates\n\n2. Self-stabilizing asset-backed credit facility\n\n- Like MakerDAO, users can unlock credit from their ETH\n- Unlike MakerDAO, debt/credit is not fixed at $1. Rather, it fluctuates based on supply and demand\n- RAI’s PI controller updates the system’s moving peg to balance demand for debt vs. credit\n\n3.

    "basename": "AIP-4",
    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nAave V2 governance is inspired by delegation-based governance models already on the market, while introducing 3 key innovations and a new layer of resilience:\n\nThe introduction of a new concept in DeFi governance - the **segregation between voting and proposition power** to increase control and ownership of voting rights for AAVE holders.\nAAVE holders will have the choice between delegating proposal creation power to specialized actors while holding their voting rights; or even delegating them to another entity.\n\n**Voting strategies** - The AAVE token exists and is used in the Aave ecosystem in a variety of ways. Through different voting strategies, AAVE in different forms can be used to vote and create proposals. In the initial implementation both AAVE and stkAAVE holders will have voting and proposal creation rights. Voting strategies can be upgraded at any time through a governance proposal to include other forms of AAVE (i.e. aAAVE, staked AAVE/ETH AMM shares, etc.)\n\n**Multiple executor entities** - Different components of the ecosystem might have different needs for consensus and security. For example, changing the AAVE token logic itself might have a large impact on the ecosystem and is something that requires higher consensus than adjusting a risk management parameter. The Aave governance V2 splits the control of different entities within the Aave ecosystem between different executors with different execution delays (timelocks) and different consensus parameters. At the beginning there will be two different executors:\n\n**a.** Executor 1 (short timelock) will control the whole Aave Protocol v1, the token distributor used in v1, the contract collecting the v1 fees, the AAVE Reserve Ecosystem and any change in this timelock itself. Once the break-in period for Aave V2 is completed, this timelock will also control the current Aave V2 market and all the future markets instantiated by the Aave Genesis Team.\n\n- admin : Aave Governance v2\n- delay : 1 day\n- grace period : 5 days\n- proposition threshold: 0.5%\n- voting duration: 3 days\n- vote differential: 0.5%\n- Approval quorum: 2%\n\n**b.** Executor 2 (long timelock) will control the upgradeability of the AAVE token, stkAAVE, any change in v2 governance parameters and any change in the parameters of this timelock itself.\n\n- admin: Aave Governance v2\n- delay: 7 days\n- grace period: 5 days\n- proposition threshold: 2%\n- voting duration: 10 days\n- vote differential: 15%\n- Approval quorum: 20%\n\nThe Guardian - As long as a large majority of AAVE tokens are in a centralised exchange, it’s impossible to prevent a STEEM-like governance attack where a centralised entity would use its users’ assets to take over a decentralised protocol through governance. As a security measure to avoid such a scenario, a temporary 5/10 multisig is given a power of veto to cancel proposals in case malicious code is introduced through an AIP. Those entities have been chosen within the AAVE community to be globally distributed, and they cover safety skill sets through governance, code, and economic analysis. Guardians can be changed later through election.\nThe current multisig signers are : James Vaugh (Fire Eyes/Metacartel), Anthony Sassano (SET protocol/ETHhub/Daily Gwei), Mariano Conti (ex MakerDAO head of smart contracts), Tarun Chitra (Gauntlet), DeFiSaver, Zerion, Parafi Capital, Framework Venture, Arthur0x and the Aave Genesis Team\nSome of the expected short-term outcomes of this implementation are new actors creating proposals for token additions, risk parameter upgrades or new liquidity market creation.\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Implementation of the Aave Governance v2 smart contract\n- Implementation of voting delegation and proposal power delegation\n- Implementation of voting strategies with the inclusion of AAVE and StkAAVE\n- Addition of voting and proposition power delegations on AAVE and SktAAVE\n- Implementation of Executor entities\n- Implementation of the Guardian\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nCreating a Governance V1 Proposal vote with the proposal executor at https://etherscan.io/address/0xd194b24913806fc885f1fecd3e776f8449e5e24a#code\n\nIf the proposal passes:\n\na.

Curve offers an optimised model for stablecoin trading and revenue sharing incentives with fees from the >$10B in cumulative trading volume\n\n## CRV Smart Contract Risk: B-\nCRV token was introduced to Curve in August 2020 through liquidity mining. The code has 3 audits from ToB, Quantstamp and MixBytes. It is central in the DAO operations enabling stakers to vote and boost their yields with the locking of CRV. This model has generated half a billion transactions in half a year, with around 15,000 holders\n\n## CRV Counterparty Risk: B\nThe Curve DAO operates as a fully decentralised organisation with community proposals and votes. The ecosystem is funded by fees of the Curve Exchange generated by the $40m of daily volume\n\n## CRV Market Risk: C\nCurve is one of the leading DeFi projects. The token is available on top exchanges with nearly $100m market capitalisation and nearly as much average daily volume though a large share of CRV’s supply is locked. CRV experienced volatility in the last month with the rest of the market having yet to recover\nCRV’s risk profile is close to YFI’s leading to the same model parameters\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n- LTV 40%\n- Liquidation Threshold 55%\n- Liquidation Bonus 15%\n- Reserve Factor 20%\n\n## Variable Interest Rate Model\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/chSyDxc.png\" />\n</p>\n\n\nCRV fits the profile of a collateral asset, with the need for a conservative borrow rate model with a low optimal utilisation to protect collateral liquidity\n\n- UOptimal 45%\n- R_0 0%\n- R_s1 7%\n- R_s2 300%\n\n### Code \nThe code is part of the standard Aave protocol deployment (the AToken, Debt tokens and interest rate strategy) therefore no audits are needed. The code can be found here https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/tree/master/contracts/protocol/tokenization\n\n### Test Cases \nBeing a standard ERC20, the Aave protocol test cases already cover everything needed to support CRV.\n\n### Security Considerations\nThe CRV token doesn’t have any specific behavior (eg. rebasing, balance increasing) and doesn’t offer meta governance functionalities since it requires locking to participate in the governance. Therefore, the standard AToken contract and corresponding debt tokens, already used for the majority of assets listed in Aave, can be also used for CRV. No auditing of the code is required.\n\n",

    "description": "\n## Simple Summary\nThe Gemini dollar is a cryptographic token that is issued by Gemini, strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens.\n\n\n## Abstract\nAdd GUSD to the AAVE V2 market.\n\n## Motivation\nGUSD is an additional fiat on-ramp into the DeFi ecosystem that will help diversify fiat sources inside of AAVE markets.\n\n## Specification\nGUSD can be exchanged for USD at a fixed 1:1 rate on the Gemini exchange. I have personally tested this out and was impressed with the results: withdraw of GUSD from Gemini exchange was sent within 1 minute using fast gas, and deposit back into Gemini was credited within ~17 block confirmation. It should be possible for liquidators (who are willing/able to KYC) to flip GUSD collateral directly through Gemini for the time being. GUSD also has a few trading pairs on other centralized exchanges such as OKEx, HitBTC, and ZB. I plan on submitting a proposal to create a GUSD Curve pool in the near future as well, if this is supported by veCRV voters the on-chain liquidity for GUSD should improve substantially.\n\n## Rationale\nBenefits for Aave:\n\nDiversification of centralized assets: GUSD relies on a different issuer and custodian compared to USDC, TUSD, USDT, or BUSD. Credit, custody, or regulatory risks may be less correlated across these assets, which could reduce risk to Aave security module stakers.\nNew DeFi on/off ramp: Gemini has good linkage with US bank wire and ACH networks, comparable to Coinbase as a fiat ramp.\nWhile Coinbase have played nice so far, it’s dominance in regulated crypto liquidity and USDC on/off ramp has huge influence over the space. I see Gemini and GUSD as a viable competitor. From an industrial economics standpoint, Aave and other Defi protocols like Maker may benefit from breaking down monopolies of their key counter-parties.\n\n## Risk Analysis\n\nThe Risk Team has applied Aave’s Risk Framework to GUSD leading to an overall risk rating of B-\n\nGUSD is issued by Gemini Trust Company. It has been created for practical use in innovative applications, among which to facilitate Gemini’s institutional solutions and exchange operations.\n\nGUSD Smart contract Risk: C+\n\nGUSD was launched in September 2018 – at the same time then USDC – yet it has only experienced 120k blockchain transactions.\n\nThe GUSD smart contract only supports 2 decimals meaning that interest accrual can only occur for more than 1 cent.\n\nUSDC Counterparty Risk: C+ cannot use as collateral (centralisation D-)\n\nAs it is backed by real US dollars, GUSD is centralised. Moreover it has few holders with most of the transactions off-chain on the centralised Gemini environment.\n\nAn independent accountant’s audit report is published at the end of each month on the website. GUSD is regulated bringing trust to the token. Still, the infrastructure is based on the Ethereum blockchain where regulators have little power.\n\nGUSD Market Risk: B -\n\nGUSD has a small market capitalisation at less than 20m with a small trading volume. The price has diverged from 1 a few times in the last 3 months with up to 3% price variation.\nGiven the reduced market capitalization and the possibility of market price manipulation, the oracle will fix the price of GUSD to $1. This does not bring additional risk because the asset cannot be used as collateral and even if the market price swings considerably, the asset is still redeemable 1:1 for USD. The risk team will reevaluate the asset periodically to validate the viability of an actual market based oracle as the GUSD supply grows.  \n\nRisk Parameters ~ BUSD sUSD\nNot a collateral\nReserve Factor 10%\n\nVariable Interest Rate Model ~ BUSD sUSD\nUOptimal 80%\n\nR_0 0%\n\nR_s1 4%\n\nR_s2 100%\n\n## References\n\n- *Whitepaper*: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-whitepaper.pdf\n- *Website*: https://gemini.com/dollar\n- *Twitter*: https://twitter.com/Gemini\n- *Source Code*: https://github.com/gemini/dollar\n- *GUSD token contract*: https://etherscan.io/token/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd\n- *Accountant’s reports at bottom of page*: https://gemini.com/dollar#reports\n- *Trail of bits contract audit*: https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-trailofbits-audit.pdf\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

In the worst-case scenario of critical failure, an amount to be decided will be slashed from stakers deposits.\n\nIn this phase 0 of the slashing, the auction mechanism will not be automatized yet and if a slash were to happen it would be done through governance and direct compensation.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Increasing the Safety Incentives: As the possibility of slashing will now be formally introduced, staking reward should reflect the risk. Hence we propose to increase the Safety Incentives to 550 AAVE per day\n- Slashing %: The maximum slashing amount is set to 30%\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nThe payload to be executed is available at\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4ab8ba929e4cc780cb82be34eea29a9ea7a58049#code\n\nThe payload will upgrade the Aave reserve contract to a new implementation\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xa335e2443b59d11337e9005c9af5bc31f8000714#code\n\nAnd introduce a reserve controller, with the rights of approving transfers/transferring assets out of the Aave Reserve, under control of the Aave governance short executor\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1e506cbb6721b83b1549fa1558332381ffa61a93#code\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

    "description": "\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nBAL is the governance token of [Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore), a programmable liquidity and asset managment protocol with over [$800M in TVL](https://defipulse.com/balancer) according to DeFi Pulse.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAdd [BAL](https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d) to the AAVE V2 market.\n\nBalancer is a DEX that uses a constant function market maker formula to allow liquidity pools with multiple tokens, custom allocations and fees. Smart pools in Balancer can be used for programmable liquidity. \n\nTraders can swap between any of the tokens listed on Balancer in exchange for a swap fee (paid to liquidity providers) and slippage based upon the relative trade size. \n\nBAL is the governance token of the Balancer exchange, entitling holders (including those providing BAL liquidity on Balancer) to vote on proposals. BAL also receives preferential treatment in the Balancer exchange liquidity mining program.\n\nBalancer is responsible for the creation of [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/), and currently leading a number of [governance intiatives](https://snapshot.page/#/balancer/proposal/QmXQpKyw1BvYgZtvC2KGqrDezWBfSUBEKK77Kx866yBLYf) to reward active contributions to the protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs Balancer gears up for the launch of Balancer V2, composability becomes key for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nAt the time of writing, BAL has a market cap of $230M.\n\nApart from the BAL liquidity on Balancer, BAL is also listed on FTX, Coinbase, Binance, Gemini and other centralized exchanges.\n\nAdding BAL to Aave will be the first major lending/borrowing market for the asset, and one that sets precedent for future exploration of Balancer Pool Token (BPT) markets similar to [Aave V1 Uniswap Markets](https://medium.com/aave/the-uniswap-market-is-live-on-aave-protocol-12b5a4cc5e2).\n\nAave leverages Balancer for it's [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module), meaning this partnership further cements the relationship between the two protocols.\n\n*\"The advantage of using Balancer against other AMM solutions is clear when we factor in the possibility of dynamically adjusting the weighting towards AAVE. This allows for the creation of a market and the provision of liquidity whilst maintaining exposure to AAVE. Holding AAVE/ETH liquidity with uneven weights is very close to simply holding AAVE, with the benefits of earning trading fees on top of it.\"*\n\n\n## Benefits for Aave\nBalancer has an increasingly active community which would bring more users and liquidity to Aave.\n\nBAL earns native rewards through liquidity mining, currently yielding upwards of 80%+ APY with limited impermanent loss. This has generated strong borrowing demand for BAL on CREAM, with deposit rates often above 10%.\n\nWith deposit rates so high, it becomes super cost effective for people to borrow funds with BAL as collateral, often times with an effective negative borrowing rate!\n\n## Specification\nBAL will continue to see increased governance activity in the coming months.\n\nAdding BAL to the Aave V2 markets will provide strong borrowing demand, generating protocol fees and allowing for further governance participation.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBalancer and Aave are natural partners. Aave leverages Balancer for it's Safety Module and it only seems natural that BAL should be listed on Aave given the depth of the AAVE liquidity Balancer today.\n\nThis proposal opens design space for future lending use-cases, both on Balancer's end and on Aave's for more niche specific liqudity pool markets.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nWhitepaper - https://balancer.finance/whitepaper 1  \nWebsite - https://balancer.finance 1  \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs  \nBlog - https://balancer.finance/blog-feed  \nDocumentation - https://docs.balancer.finance  \nSource Code - https://github.com/balancer-labs 2  \nBAL Token Contract - https://etherscan.io/address/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#code 1  \n\n\n## Audits/Security Reviews\n[Trail of Bits, Conesnsys Dilligence and Open Zeppelin.](https://docs.balancer.finance/core-concepts/security/audits)  \n\n[AAVE Community x BAL Risk Assesment](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-bal/1787/6?u=coopahtroopa)  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lrXmHFD.png)  \n\n**BAL Smart contract Risk: B-**\n\nSince it's launch in June BAL has reached half a million transactions driven by liquidity mining distribution program which may lead to inflation.

    "description": "\n\n## AIP rationale\n\nAs stated in the [Aavenomics paper](https://aave.com/Aavenomics.pdf), the AAVE asset is designed to become the center of gravity for Aave governance and the protocol safety, The Safety Incentives (SI) allocation is designed to incentivize the lines of defenses of the Aave protocol.\n\nAIP-1 was the first step of the activations of the lines of defenses of the Aave Protocol with the activation of the safety module, for the Safety to be as efficient as possible, it is required to reach significant liquidity of the AAVE asset on a Decentralized AMM.\n\nThis AIP aims at incentivizing the Liquidity providing for the AAVE asset on a specificaly designed smart pool of the Balancer protocol to make the AAVE asset more liquid on-chain by activation Safety Incentives (SI) for BPT tokens stakers.\n\nABPT (Aave Balancer Pool Token) tokens can be obtained by providing liquidity to the AAVE/ETH Balancer smart pool at a 80/20 ratio. The contract of the ABPT can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84).\n\nThis AIP, if accepted by the community, will start the Safety Incentive (SI) rewards distribution for ABPT stakers at the rate of 550 AAVE/day. The contract of the stkABPT can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47).\n\nThe Safety Module is designed as an additional line of defense for Aave protocol liquidity providers and Both highliquidity and Safety module reserve can mitigate the possibility of bad debt in the occurence of a shortfall event.\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Start of the Safety Incentives for ABPT stakers with initial SI rewards of 550 AAVE/day.\n\n## Safety Incentives Schedule\n\nIf the community accepts the current AIP, the Safety Incentives will add 550 AAVE/day to the ABPT tokens Stakers.\n\nFor a total of 1100 AAVE/day Safety Incentives allocation.\n\nThe Safety Incentive's allocation quarterly date should be voted on before the end of the 3 months (90 days) distribution schedule. In the case of a late or no vote on a new SI allocation plan, the current allocation will continue until a vote or until the ER is empty.\n\n## Implementations details\n\nThe implementation of the AIP consist in three actions: \n- Transfer proxy ownerships of [ABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84) and [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) to the Long Timelocked Governance Executor.\n- Configure [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) to reward stakers for 550 AAVE per day.\n- Approve 550 AAVE per day for 3 months allowance from Reserve for [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) rewards.\n\nIf this AIP is validated by a community vote, the following addresses will be involved in the execution process :\n\n- [AIP9 Proposal Payload](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd08E12367A7D68CAA8ff080D3A56b2dc6650709b#contracts)\n- [ABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84)\n- [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47)\n- [Aave Reserve Controller](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)."
