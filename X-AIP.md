This is the template for AIPs.

When opening a pull request to submit your AIP, please use an uppercase abbreviated title in the filename, `TITLE_ABBREV.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

## Simple Summary

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the AIP.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for AIPs that want to change Aave. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the AIP solves. AIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## References
